## üìù A live-updating Markdown viewer

This is a small tool that allows you to instantly see changes you make to a
Markdown document. It is written in [Go](https://www.golang.org) and uses the
[Blackfriday](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday) library for parsing the
Markdown. [statik](https://github.com/rakyll/statik) is used to embed the
templates into the binary.

## Installation

```

## Usage
